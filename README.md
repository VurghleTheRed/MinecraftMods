**Set up Neoforge Modloader:**
These mods require the game to be Minecraft version 1.21.1 to run.
If you know you have played Minecraft on 1.21.1, you can skip this step:
    Open Minecraft. At the bar at the top, select *Installations*. Hit *New Installation*. Give it whatever name. Under version, select release 1.21.1, and hit *Install*. It should launch the game. Make a temporary world in this installation, as this will load the version for you to use later.

If you are using basically any Minecraft launch other than the normal one, you can ignore this step:
    Go to https://projects.neoforged.net/neoforged/neoforge. On the right, select Minecraft Version 1.21.1. You can leave Neo Version as the default.
    Hit download. You should get a neoforge-"something"-installer.jar file. Run that file (if you are on a Mac, you may get permission issues, as the Mac does not trust .jar files from the internet. If so, lmk and we can troubleshoot). Select *Install Client* and follow the directions. That should create a Neoforge installation in your Minecraft launcher, which will let you run mods.

If you ARE using any other launcher, simply create a new instance and include Neoforge for 1.21.1 in the instance. It will handle downloading and setting up those files for you.


**Install Mods:**
If you are NOT using the Modrinth app or a launcher that supports Modrinth (like Prism):
    Click on mods.zip. From there, download the .zip file. Unzip the file. That should create a folder called mods. Leave that for now. Find your Neoforge installation you created earlier in the *Installations* tab in the Minecraft launcher. Hover over the right hand side and select the *Open Installations Folder* button. If you do not have a folder named mods here, create one. It must be lowercase. Then, simply drag and drop the mods from the mods folder you got from the .zip file into the mods folder for your Neoforge installation.

If you ARE using a launcher that supports Modrinth:
    Download the TheMods.mrpack file. You can use that to get the modpack directly, but I'm tired and don't want to look that up rn ü•±. If you want to use this option, we can work through it together, and I'll update this document with our findings.

That should be it. You could run your Neoforge Installation to make sure everything is working correctly. If you run into any issues, I'm happy to help.

**The Mods**
**You must install all mods except Dynamic Lights and Sort it Out to connect**

üó∫Ô∏è Biomes O' Plenty: Adds 50+ new biomes to the game across all three dimensions. Some biomes add new resources to the game.
